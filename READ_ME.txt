Thank you for using EnsaEats !


/// Installing ///
To start the application please run the file start.py and start-api.py in two different 
bash terminals with the command with the command 'python file_name.py', you should have 
installed before the requirements that you can find in the file requirements.txt. 
Moreover you should be located in Ensai or at least connected in school virtual
machines so as to use EnsaEats.                                

/// How it works? ///
To use our application you should first create an account and remember your 
password for next time for authentication. EnsaEats helps you seaching restaurants by keyword,
by location or by categories. All restaurants proposed by our application
are open and able to receive your order at the time you do the research. 
You have two options of search : by keyword around you or without keyword. 
If you search without keyword you will have a list of categories around you proposed by 
your application. Then when you found out your heart's desire, you can add or delete to 
your order the meals you want, and when you finished the order will
be treated by the restaurant and come quickly to your house.
